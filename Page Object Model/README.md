 Page Object model is a design pattern which helps in:
- Code maintenancce
- Code reuseablility
 
You can store all locators and respective methods in the separate class and Call them from the test in which you have to use. So the benefit from this will be if any changes in Page then you do not have to modify the test simply modify the respective page and that all.
